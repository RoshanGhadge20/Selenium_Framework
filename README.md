# Selenium-powered Automation Framework in Java 🤖🚀

Welcome to the Selenium-powered Automation Framework in Java! This framework is designed to automate web testing using Selenium with Java, along with other techniques such as TestNG, Maven, Reports, Surefire plugins, Jenkins, and Cucumber BDD Framework. 🌐🔍

## Features

- Utilizes Selenium WebDriver for browser automation. 🌐
- Implements TestNG for test case management and execution. 📝
- Integrated with Maven for project management and dependency handling. 🛠️
- Generates comprehensive test reports using various reporting plugins. 📊
- Seamless integration with Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment. 🔄
- Supports behavior-driven development (BDD) using Cucumber framework. 🥒

## Prerequisites

Before using this framework, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) ☕
- Maven 📦
- IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.) 💻
- WebDriver compatible browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) 🌐
- Jenkins (optional for CI/CD) 🛠️

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Import the project into your preferred IDE.
3. Install dependencies using Maven.
4. Write your test cases using TestNG annotations or Cucumber BDD feature files.
5. Run tests locally or integrate with Jenkins for automated execution.

### Writing Test Cases

- Use TestNG annotations to define test methods and test suites.
- Leverage the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for efficient test case maintenance.
- Create feature files using Gherkin syntax for BDD scenarios with Cucumber.

### Running Tests

- Execute tests locally using IDE or Maven commands.
- Integrate with Jenkins for automated test execution on CI/CD pipelines.

### Viewing Reports

- Access test reports generated by TestNG or customized reports generated by other plugins.
- Analyze test results to identify successes, failures, and overall test coverage.
